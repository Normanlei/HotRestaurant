# HotRestaurant

## Description

A good reservation system is critical for a restraurant, especially for those famous and always-busy restraurants. My class team and I are creating a reservation template to take reservations and waitlist with abilities of letting users to edit their own reservation with entering their correct pin code. 

##### Here are what current application is built as below:
* Home Landing Page with api links
* View Table Page with reservation list and waitlist
* Make Reservation Page with restritive inputs

##### Future Developments:
* Add setting functionalities for owner editting their parameters
* Connecting with owner-side server
* Add texting and emailing functionalities

### Demo

* Familiarize utilizing <b>node.js</b> and <b>express.js</b>
